The way the game works is as the following:
1. The player starts with 0 points in the bottom center of the canvas.
2. if the player reaches the water (top end of the canvas), the player gains a point.
3. if the player hits one of the enemies the counter resets to 0.
4. When the player reaches 10 points, the player wins :D

How to run the game:
1. Double click index.html
2. Have fun.
